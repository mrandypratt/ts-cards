# Cards with Friends - Open Source Cards Against Humanity Clone

This game a clone of Cards Against Humanity inspired by the gameplay style of Jackbox.tv games.

The game is currently live and can be played by visiting www.CardsWithFriendsGame.com.

Cards with Friends is created with in-person or video-call gatherings in mind, so right now you'll need two friends.

For those flying solo, just hang tight, as our next feature is solo-mode and is coming within the week.
